# Practice projects to learn Cpp
* Fizz Buzz
	* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
* Collatz Conjecture
	* Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one(1) using the following process: If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
* Sorting Algorithms
	* Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.
* Caesar Cipher
	* Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
